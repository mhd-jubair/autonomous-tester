http://localhost:8000

Endpoints:

1. Health Check
   ---------------
   Endpoint: GET /health
   Description: Check if the API server is running and healthy.
   
   Request:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: /health
   - Body: None
   
   Response (Success - 200 OK):
   {
       "status": "ok"
   }

2. User Login
   ---------------
   Endpoint: POST /login
   Description: Authenticate a user with email and password credentials.
   
   Request:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: /login
   - Content-Type: application/json
   - Body:
     {
         "email": "user@test.com",
         "password": "password123"
     }
   
   Response (Success - 200 OK):
   {
       "message": "Login successful",
       "role": "user"
   }
   
   Response (Error - 404 Not Found):
   {
       "detail": "User not found"
   }
   
   Response (Error - 401 Unauthorized):
   {
       "detail": "Invalid password"
   }

Test Users:
   Email: user@test.com
   Password: password123
   
   Email: admin@test.com
   Password: admin123

Functional Requirements:

FR-001: Health Check
   - The API shall respond to GET /health requests
   - The API shall return status "ok" when the server is running

FR-002: User Login
   - The API shall accept email and password in the request body
   - The API shall validate that the email exists in the system
   - The API shall validate that the password matches the stored password
   - The API shall return "Login successful" message on valid credentials
   - The API shall return 404 error if user email is not found
   - The API shall return 401 error if password is incorrect

Test Scenarios:

Positive Test Cases:
   1. Login with valid user credentials (user@test.com / password123)
   2. Login with valid admin credentials (admin@test.com / admin123)
   3. Health check returns status ok

Negative Test Cases:
   1. Login with non-existent email (should return 404)
   2. Login with wrong password for existing user (should return 401)
